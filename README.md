This repository is for the project of the COMP-472 course, given by Concordia University in Montreal.

The goal of the project was to build and train 4 separate AI models using:
Naive Bayes, a Decision Tree, an MLP and a CNN.

The files are described as followed:

Decision_tree_classifier.ipynb <-- The file containing the python script for the Decision Tree
naive_Bayes_model.ipynb <-- The file containing the python script for the Naive Bayes
three-variant-MLP.ipynb <-- The file containing the python script for the MLP
VGG11_CNN.ipynb <-- The file containing the python script for the VG11 CNN

Using Anaconda Prompt, run the environment using:

_conda activate cifar10_

_jupyter notebook_

Then, inside Jupyter notebook, SHIFT-ENTER each cell except the ones denoted as training.
The trained models have already been saved and must simply be loaded in and the metrics can be ran against those saved models.
